    <h1>Turtle Crossing Game</h1>

    <p>This is a simple game created using Python's turtle module. The goal of the game is for the turtle to cross the road without getting hit by the cars.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the up arrow key to move the turtle forward.</li>
        <li>Avoid getting hit by the cars.</li>
        <li>If you successfully cross the road, the level will increase and the cars will move faster.</li>
        <li>If you get hit by a car, the game is over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player:</strong> The turtle that you control.</li>
        <li><strong>Cars:</strong> The obstacles that move across the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoreboard:</strong> Keeps track of the player's level and displays the game over message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>player.py:</strong> Contains the Player class, which represents the turtle that the player controls.</li>
        <li><strong>car_manager.py:</strong> Contains the CarManager class, which is responsible for creating and moving the cars.</li>
        <li><strong>scoreboard.py:</strong> Contains the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the player's level and displays the game over message.</li>
        <li><strong>main.py:</strong> The main file that runs the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Running the Game</h2>
    <p>To run the game, simply run the <code>main.py</code> file in your Python environment.</p>
    <p>Note that you will need Python and the turtle module installed on your computer to run the game.</p>

    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>This game was created by [Your Name] as a learning project using Python's turtle module.</p>
